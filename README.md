# Nippon Printing Company Website

## A static, responsive website built for a local packaging firm using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is a personal project where I collaborated with a local business owner of a packaging firm to develop a beautiful, informative and responsive company website. This website is to help them build digital presence, and also help bring in new clients by informing visitors of what the firm actually does.
